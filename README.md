# Robot-sensors-aerospace
In this repository I will code the robot sensors and ROS servers for aerospace projects

The satellites need a combination of signaling with embedded CPUs such RODOS or ROS and the mathematical trajectories with python, and the resilience materials with mechanics and thermodynamics in python and aerospace education programs for aerospace software newcomers.

This project is based on my aerospace engiennering education, & Thermodynamics modeling and modern robotics

Software-utility(system calls for c++ files)
Strace is a useful tool to test linux kernel signal logs that comes
from any kind of robot file or c++ file.

Debuggers are useful to test the robot sensors for the aerospace industry.
